# mixxx-title-grabber-macos
Grab Mixxx's Title and Save to a file. (But for MacOS)

## Get started

To get started is very easy. Just head to [Release](https://github.com/ssysm/mixxx-title-grabber-macos/releases) and grab the latest binary.

## Default Config

These are the default config that's baked inside the program:

 - Now playing file location: `[Document Folder]/nowPlaying-mixxx.txt`
 - Polling period: 150 ms

 If you would like to change those values, please compile the program yourself. A config flag is planned.
